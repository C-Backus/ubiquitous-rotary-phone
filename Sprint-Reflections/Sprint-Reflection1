The goals for the first sprint were essentially building the page architecture. Originally, I had only thought of the home page, the login page, and the user profile page. 
This scope expanded to include a register page (similar to the login page, but obviously where a new user registers an account). Naturally what came with these html pages 
was their shared css style document. The html pages are properly linked to each other, which was an implicit goal of this sprint based on the structure of the application 
outlined in my proposal. All goals were met for this sprint.<br>

Next sprint will focus primarily on facilitating the functions of a user logging in and logging out. This includes user account creation, password storage, and password 
validation. I am hopeful to also begin tackling GPS services for the post architecture and post interaction. <br>
